(** * RTA for Fully Non-Preemptive FP Scheduling on Uniprocessors under the Periodic Resource Model *)

(** In the following, we derive a response-time analysis for non-preemptive FP
    scheduling, assuming a workload of sporadic real-time tasks, characterized
    by arbitrary arrival curves, executing upon a uniprocessor under the
    periodic resource model (see "Periodic Resource Model for Compositional
    Real-Time Guarantees" by Shin & Lee, RTSS 2003). To this end, we instantiate
    the sequential variant of _abstract Restricted-Supply Analysis_ (aRSA) as
    provided in the [prosa.analysis.abstract.restricted_supply] module. *)

Section RTAforFullyNonPreemptiveFPModelwithArrivalCurves.

  (** ** Defining the System Model *)

  (** Before any formal claims can be stated, an initial setup is needed to
      define the system model under consideration. To this end, we next
      introduce and define the following notions using Prosa's standard
      definitions and behavioral semantics:

      - tasks, jobs, and their parameters,
      - the task set and the task under analysis,
      - the processor model,
      - the sequence of job arrivals,
      - the absence of self-suspensions,
      - an arbitrary schedule of the task set, and finally,
      - the resource-supply model. *)

  (** *** Tasks and Jobs  *)

  (** Consider tasks characterized by a WCET [task_cost] and an arrival curve
      [max_arrivals], ... *)
  Context {Task : TaskType} `{TaskCost Task} `{MaxArrivals Task}.

  (** ... and their associated jobs, where each job has a corresponding task
      [job_task], an execution time [job_cost], and an arrival time
      [job_arrival]. *)
  Context {Job : JobType} `{JobTask Job Task} `{JobCost Job} `{JobArrival Job}.

  (** Furthermore, assume that jobs and tasks are fully non-preemptive. *)
  #[local] Existing Instance fully_nonpreemptive_job_model.
  #[local] Existing Instance fully_nonpreemptive_task_model.
  #[local] Existing Instance fully_nonpreemptive_rtc_threshold.

  (** *** The Task Set and the Task Under Analysis *)

  (** Consider an arbitrary task set [ts], and ... *)
  Variable ts : seq Task.

  (** ... let [tsk] be any task in [ts] that is to be analyzed. *)
  Variable tsk : Task.
  Hypothesis H_tsk_in_ts : tsk \in ts.

  (** *** Processor Model *)

  (** Consider any kind of fully-supply-consuming, unit-supply
      processor state model. *)
  Context `{PState : ProcessorState Job}.
  Hypothesis H_uniprocessor_proc_model : uniprocessor_model PState.
  Hypothesis H_unit_supply_proc_model : unit_supply_proc_model PState.
  Hypothesis H_consumed_supply_proc_model : fully_consuming_proc_model PState.

  (** *** The Job Arrival Sequence *)

  (** Allow for any possible arrival sequence [arr_seq] consistent with the
      parameters of the task set [ts]. That is, [arr_seq] is a valid arrival
      sequence in which each job's cost is upper-bounded by its task's WCET,
      every job stems from a task in [ts], and the number of arrivals respects
      each task's [max_arrivals] bound. *)
  Variable arr_seq : arrival_sequence Job.
  Hypothesis H_valid_task_arrival_sequence : valid_task_arrival_sequence ts arr_seq.

  (** *** Absence of Self-Suspensions *)

  (** We assume the classic (i.e., Liu & Layland) model of readiness without
      jitter or self-suspensions, wherein pending jobs are always ready. *)
  #[local] Existing Instance basic_ready_instance.

  (** *** The Schedule *)

  (** Consider an arbitrary fixed-priority policy [FP] that indicates a
      higher-or-equal priority relation among the tasks in [ts], and assume that
      the relation is reflexive and transitive. *)
  Context {FP : FP_policy Task}.
  Hypothesis H_priority_is_reflexive : reflexive_task_priorities FP.
  Hypothesis H_priority_is_transitive : transitive_task_priorities FP.

  (** Consider a non-preemptive, work-conserving, valid uniprocessor schedule
      that corresponds to the given arrival sequence [arr_seq] (and hence the
      given task set [ts]). *)
  Variable sched : schedule PState.
  Hypothesis H_valid_schedule : valid_schedule sched arr_seq.
  Hypothesis H_work_conserving : work_conserving arr_seq sched.
  Hypothesis H_nonpreemptive_sched : nonpreemptive_schedule sched.

  (** We assume that the schedule respects the given [FP] scheduling policy. *)
  Hypothesis H_respects_policy :
    respects_FP_policy_at_preemption_point arr_seq sched FP.

  (** Furthermore, we require that the schedule ensures that jobs of the same
      task are executed in the order of their arrival. *)
  Hypothesis H_sequential_tasks : sequential_tasks arr_seq sched.

  (** *** Periodic Resource Model *)

  (** Assume that the processor supply follows the *periodic resource model* as
      defined in "Periodic Resource Model for Compositional Real-Time
      Guarantees" by Shin & Lee (RTSS 2003). Under this model, the supply is
      distributed periodically with a resource period [Π] and a resource
      allocation time [γ]: in every interval <<[Π⋅k, Π⋅(k+1))>>, the processor
      provides at least [γ] units of supply. Furthermore, let [prm_sbf Π γ]
      denote the corresponding SBF defined in the paper, which, as proven in the
      same paper and verified in [prosa.analysis.facts.model.sbf.periodic], is a
      valid SBF. *)
  Variable Π γ : duration.
  Hypothesis H_periodic_resource_model : periodic_resource_model Π γ sched.

  (** ** Maximum Length of a Busy Interval *)

  (** In order to apply aRSA, we require a bound on the maximum busy-window
      length.  To this end, let [L] be any positive solution of the
      busy-interval "recurrence" (i.e., inequality) [prm_sbf Π γ L >=
      blocking_bound ts tsk + total_hep_request_bound_function_FP ts tsk L], as
      defined below.

      As the lemma [busy_intervals_are_bounded_rs_fp] shows, under [FP]
      scheduling, this condition is sufficient to guarantee that the maximum
      busy-window length is at most [L], i.e., the length of any busy interval
      is bounded by [L]. *)
  Definition busy_window_recurrence_solution (L : duration) :=
    L > 0
    /\ prm_sbf Π γ L >= blocking_bound ts tsk + total_hep_request_bound_function_FP ts tsk L.

  (** ** Response-Time Bound *)

  (** Having established all necessary preliminaries, it is finally time to
      state the claimed response-time bound [R]. *)

  (** A value [R] is a response-time bound for task [tsk] if, for any given
      offset [A] in the search space (w.r.t. the busy-window bound [L]), the
      response-time bound "recurrence" (i.e., inequality) has a solution [F] not
      exceeding [A + R]. *)
  Definition rta_recurrence_solution L R :=
    forall (A : duration),
      is_in_search_space tsk L A ->
      exists (F : duration),
        prm_sbf Π γ F >= blocking_bound ts tsk
                        + (task_request_bound_function tsk (A + ε) - (task_cost tsk - ε))
                        + total_ohep_request_bound_function_FP ts tsk F
        /\ prm_sbf Π γ (A + R) >= prm_sbf Π γ F + (task_cost tsk - ε)
        /\ A + R >= F.

  (** Finally, using the sequential variant of abstract restricted-supply
      analysis, we establish that, given a bound on the maximum busy-window
      length [L], any such [R] is indeed a sound response-time bound for task
      [tsk] under fully-non-preemptive fixed-priority scheduling on a unit-speed
      uniprocessor under the periodic resource model. *)
